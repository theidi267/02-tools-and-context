## Submission Instructions
* Work in a fork of this repository
* Work in a branch on your fork
* Write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-susan`
* Open a pull request to this repository
* Submit on canvas a question and observation, how long you spent, and a link to your pull request

## Configuration
Configure the root of your repository with the following files and directories. Thoughtfully name and organize any additional configuration or module files.
* **README.md** - contains documentation
* **.gitignore** - contains a [robust](http://gitignore.io) `.gitignore` file
* **.eslintrc.json** - contains the course linter configuratoin
* **.eslintignore** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
* **.travis.yml** - travis-ci configuration file
* **package.json** - contains npm package config
  * create a `lint` script for running eslint
  * create a `test` script for running tests
* **lib/** - contains module definitions
* **\_\_test\_\_/** - contains unit tests

## Feature Tasks

#### List Module
  * implement a List constructor using a constructor, factory, or class
  * implement the length property
  * implement `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, and `unshift()` methods on the List prototype
  * implement `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` as pure methods on the List prototype
  * implement `slice()`, and `splice()` as methods on the List prototype
  * Do not use any built-in array methods to do this
  
#### Stretch Goals
  * Repeat the above process, using call/apply/bind to interface with built-in array methods.
  * e.g.
  `map(list, callback) { 
    return Array.prototype.map.call( list, callback ); 
  }`

## Testing
Create a NodeJS module in the \_\_test\_\_/ directory named `list.test.js` that asserts the correctness of the list module.

Use the `describe` and `it` (or `test`) methods to define descriptive tests and increase readablity
Each `it` callback should aim to test a small, well defined, feature of a function - this may include:
  * tests that ensure the list module functions correctly with error-check parameters
  * tests that the correct errors are thrown with invalid arguments exist
  * tests to ensure that the list module functions return the correct results when invoked with valid arguments

##  Documentation
Include your travis badge at the top of your `README.md` file
In your `README.md`, describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to add any additional information in your `README.md` that you would like.
