# Lab 02 - Tools and Context

[![Build Status]()]()

## Overview
This a module that focuses on making methods, that match the built array methods that we are so used to, from scratch. 

This list module includes array methods such as ```push()```, ```pop()```, ```shift()```, , ```forEach()```, ```map()```, .

In this module, I utilize Test Driven Development to make sure our module operated as expected and I integrated with Travis to verify successful builds as I deploy to GitHub.
